    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>1. <b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You
        can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</p>
    <p>2. <b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter oil.</p>
    <p>3. <b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the
        eggs evenly coat the surface.</p>
    <p>4. <b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</p>
    <p>5. <b> Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</p>
    <p>6. <b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</p>
